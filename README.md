# JimBot JS
### 0.1.1
Source Code for the rewritten jimbot, now in JavaScript

Since the end of support for discord.py, I've rewritten jimbot in a different
langugage to faciliate ongoing development. Still in alpha stage as of now.


Register commands with discords api by using node deploy-commands.js
Run the bot with npm start
